# grrs

Just a basic grep clone written in Rust. Could have also been called minigrep. It only does a basic search and it only prints out the lines containing the specified query.

This is an exercise from the book *[The Rust Programming language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)*

This is the second project exercise from the book, focusing on creating Command Line Programs. I made sure to do this exercise two times because Rust has quite a learning curve. The first time going through this exercise I was kind of lost and just following along copying the code. This second time I approached it trying to write the code by myself before reading the Code Listings. I learned that I managed to do some good progress by myself but at times I still needed to check the text. Still, it was a good learning activity.
